title: This is my first post. A bright day in the history of the internet.
---

From now on this site will contribute to the internet with unbelievably cool things! 

Yes, this really is my first post on my shiny new blog, tough there will be posts in the future that have dates in the past (O_o). The plan is to show a couple of projects that are already finished but never found their way online! Also there are some on f***book already, they should become available to a wider audience now.
 
Thanks to Github user barryclark&#39;s jekyll-now github repo, building the basics of this blog went fairly fast. Thanks Barry, brilliant idea!
