From now on this site will contribute to the internet with unbelievably cool things! 

Yes, this really _is_ my first post on my shiny new blog, though there will be posts in the future that have dates in the past ;-) The reason are some projects that were finished some time ago but never found their way online. Also I uploaded some things to f***book already that should become available to a broader audience now.
 
Thanks to barryclark&#39;s [jekyll-now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on github, building the foundation of this blog went fairly fast. Thanks Barry, brilliant idea!
