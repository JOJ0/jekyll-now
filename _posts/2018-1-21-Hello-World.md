title: This is my first post. A bright day in internet history.
---

From now on this site will contribute to the internet with unbelievably cool things! 

Yes, this really _is_ my first post on my shiny new blog, though there will be posts in the future that have dates in the past ;-) I&#39;ll be showing a couple of projects that are already finished but never found their way online! Also there are some on f***book already that should become available to a broader audience now.
 
Thanks to Github user barryclark&#39;s [jekyll-now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), building the basics of this blog went fairly fast. Thanks Barry, brilliant idea!
