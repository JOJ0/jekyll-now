I'd appreciate any form of feedback regarding on what use cases you could think of for mass manipulating .SEQ files (eg with .PGM filenames, track names or anything else that is saved in a sequence). Also usability improvement suggestions are very welcome. I created this tool as a helper for my very own special use case, I am sure there would be more possibilities. Now that I own the basics about what's in a .SEQ file, it would be rather easy to expand it. Tell me what you think!
