Dancing always was its passion...

It had to fight against evil creatures, he wasn't to bad at it...but never really loved what he was doing.....

Yes! It just ran off the ring and let the fighting be. He was struggling with himself, hanging around on the television for months, drinking, drugs, you kown the game... 


...after a while (it must have been a year or two) it managed to get himself together and did what it always should have done: He became a stage dancer with a famous rock band. A star was born again!!!
