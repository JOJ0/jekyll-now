Dancing always was its passion...
<br><br>

... but its parents wont't let it live its dream.... it should attend a carreer as a Robo-Sumo-Fighter like its father and its grandmother did (they all were really bad at it and didn't earn much fame obviously!)

...after a while (it must have been a year or two) it managed to get himself together and did what it always should have done: He became a stage dancer with a famous rock band.
