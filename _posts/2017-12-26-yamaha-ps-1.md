While searching for circuit bendable cheap old broken drum machines on an online second hand platform, my sister tells me that there might be something of interest on the attic...

The PortaSound PS-1 was the first in a series of Yamaha Homekeyboards around 1980, there was a PS-2 that had more keys and additional functions, and an even bigger one called PS-3.<br>
nice &#34;travel case&#34;, obviously bought at Viennas classic music store Votruba, 6.3 inch headphone jack (!), expression pedal connector (controls volume), sustain pedal would have been nice too but you can&#39;t have everything

Through-Hole components :-)) unfortunately the cpu is not exactly the same as the one built into the PS-2 (so just copying this probably wont be enough: [http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/Yamaha_PS-2.html](http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/Yamaha_PS-2.html)). hopefully stuff works quite similar anyway

first mod working: out of the box the 4 rhythms can&#39;t be combined to play simultaneously. with some trace cutting and rewiring it&#39;s possible. I followed the instructions on this site [http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/Yamaha_PS-2.html](http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/Yamaha_PS-2.html), for the PS-1 this mod works exactely the same. What is not exactely stated on the site is that you dont have to do any rewiring on the most right rhythm button (Latin)
