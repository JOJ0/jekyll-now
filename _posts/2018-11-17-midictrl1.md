MIDI controllers are not the most complicated things to build and program. If you have your MIDI basics covered and have a little experience with Arduino-type microcontrollers it's just a matter of capturing an inputdevice (button, knob, ...) into your microcontroller and sending some bytes out via a serial port, which MIDI essentially is.

There is a lot about building basic MIDI controllers on the net already so I won't cover that, but give an overview of what helped me to get going last year:

  * [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L7WAMFWSgY&index=80&t=0s&list=PLcHqk0rpp8br1wTI-LeNKtxVmEKB1YT8O) is probably the best explanation of how MIDI circuits really work from an electrical point of view.
  * [This basic MIDI controllers tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXhxdsGREsU) is from the same guy but unfortunately he doesn't explain much how it actually works, you won't learn coding with this one.
  * [Video series ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8ANKYeWEXshCLOS9sFfcQNigYXEb1Ps6) in german language for absolute beginners without any Arduino experience. Also he doesn't use any libraries but explains how to do everything from scratch.
  * [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVf_el4N0tI&t=54s) is quite nice, he's using a Teensy microcontroller which has MIDI over USB by default

Speaking of: just to get one slightly dissapointing thing straight from the beginning: Most of the common Arduino types are not capable of natively spitting out MIDI on their USB ports, but I'm going to show a hardware-hackish approach to still make it work. A few Arduinos have native USB capabilities and can make use of the [MIDIUSB library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB) , but that's usually the type of Arduino you don't have at hand at the right moment. The only one's that have USB-MIDI out of the box are the Teensy's but they cost a little more, if you don't want any hassle go get one! [This is the website of the founder](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/), you'll find excellent documentation there.


## The input device

This is going to be my chosen input device, a button matrix out of a 1995 landline phone, built by the company Kapsch, model TP80.

</div>


So wtf is a matrix? [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlW77pAyDx4&t=1s&list=PLcHqk0rpp8br1wTI-LeNKtxVmEKB1YT8O&index=5) explains it quite well, just ignore the voltage ladder for now. [The german speaking guy over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaqzTHOvpH8&t=1604s&list=PLcHqk0rpp8br1wTI-LeNKtxVmEKB1YT8O&index=10), altough a bit more advanced, is explaining useful things, he uses a button matrix out of an old chipcard terminal.

Personally my first experience with a button/keyboard matrix was the tiny 80s keyboard featured in [one of my blog posts]({% post_url 2017-12-26-yamaha-ps-1 %}). I found a lot of information about a similar keyboard on [this website](http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/Yamaha_PS-2.html). The website owner even has put together a whole [FAQ](http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/WarrantyVoidFAQ.htm) about circuit bending and especially hacking keyboards. Scroll down a little (well a lot, it's long) and look for headlines containing keyboard matrix. Deadly useful information there!!!
