MIDI controllers are not the most complicated things to build and program. If you have your MIDI basics straight and have a little experience with Arduino-type microcontrollers it's just a matter of capturing an inputdevice (button, knob, ...) into your microcontroller and sending some bytes out via a serial port, which MIDI essentially is.

There is a lot about building basic MIDI controllers on the net already so I won't cover that, but give an overview of what helped me to get going last year:

  * [Video series ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8ANKYeWEXshCLOS9sFfcQNigYXEb1Ps6) in german language for absolute beginners without any Arduino experience
  * [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L7WAMFWSgY&index=80&t=0s&list=PLcHqk0rpp8br1wTI-LeNKtxVmEKB1YT8O) is probably the best explanation of how MIDI circuits really work!
  * [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXhxdsGREsU) is from the same guy but unfortunately he doesn't explain much how it actually works, you won't learn coding with this.
  * This is quite nice, he's using a Teensy microcontroller which has [MIDI over USB by default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXhxdsGREsU)

### The input device

This is going to be my chosen input device, a button matrix out of a 1995 phone, built by the company Kapsch, model TP80.
